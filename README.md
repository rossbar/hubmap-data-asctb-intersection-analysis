# Comparing ASCT+B tables to HubMAP data marker panels

Feedback welcome!

## Data

Data is from the [HubMAP CCF ASCT+B reporter][reporter].
The `.json` dataset originates from the `Export` button, and the `.csv` dataset
from the `Data Tables` button.

## Running yourself

Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` and download data.
Analyses available either as scripts (see the `.py` files in this directory)
or as a notebook.
To run the latter, install additional dependencies (`pip install -r doc/requirements.txt`)
and open `index.md` in your preferred Jupyter notebook interface.
